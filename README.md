# triton-transformers

This will be an implementation of  transformers using triton, 
- This is my first introduction to low-level GPU coding neurel networks i guess. 
- I will try to Also train the model not sure yet but maybe 
- As of right now I am still learning Triton 

## The plan  
my plan is to start with simple neurel network and then move upwards to transformers 

- I have been able to code and train a very simple MLP using triton on the Cifar10 datasets but it is kinda slow 6 seconds per epoch where was pytorch is 3 seconds per epoch now my task is too try to optimize this code and then I will push the code here
